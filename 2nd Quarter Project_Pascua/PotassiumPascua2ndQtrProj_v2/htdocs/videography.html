<p id="VIDEOGRAPHY_vid1_text"> The video on the left shows a tracking shot, where you basically just track a moving subject. This is one of the easiest tricks to capturing cinematic videos, and when done properly, you would be left with exemplary footage.</p>

<p id="VIDEOGRAPHY_vid2_text">The video shown on the left I believe, is one of the most common drone shot for novice pilots. Although having simple movement, the shot you can get is quite simplistic and cinematic at the same time. This can be done by finding a point of interest, and just simply moving your drone backwards, to get this somewhat reveal shot.</p>

<p id="VIDEOGRAPHY_vid3_text">The video shown on the left is an orbited footage of a moving boat. In this shot, the drone moves about the boat as like a point of interest. The drone moves along with the boat, so relatively, the footage is more dynamic, and cinematic. This trick however requires a bit more practice, skill and a whole lot of precision. But just like everything else, once you've nailed the shot, it can leave you with a cinematic, movie looking video. </p>
