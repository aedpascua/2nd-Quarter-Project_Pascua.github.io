  <p>Aerial Photography is a very special hobby to me. I have just recently started my journey in 2021, learning how to master techniques in taking great shots through videos in youtube. Although not undertaking proper photography lessons, I think that the aerial photography is a very easy hobby to master, as long as you know the basics in taking photos and maneuvering a drone. In this webpage, the fundamentals, as well as my personal techniques, and tips on how to perfect aerial photography and videography are covered.  </p>
